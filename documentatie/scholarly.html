        <h3>2.3 Design and Implementation Constraints </h3>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>2.3.1 Framework: Next.js</strong></p>
        <p> Next.js is a popular, open-source React framework used for building web applications with various rendering
          options.
          It offers a number of advantages that fit well with the needs of your application. Key Features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</strong>: This means that pages are rendered on the server, and the
            fully generated HTML is sent to the browser, rather than relying on client-side JavaScript to generate the
            content. SSR is particularly useful for improving SEO and page load times.
            When a user requests a page, the server handles the rendering, and the page is ready to be displayed in the
            browser almost instantly.</li>
          <li><strong>Static Site Generation (SSG)</strong>: This is another rendering option that Next.js supports. SSG
            pre-renders pages at build time,
            allowing for fast load times and better performance when serving static content.</li>
          <li><strong>API Routes</strong>: Next.js allows you to define API routes within the same project as your
            frontend. This means you don't need a separate backend server to handle data requests; Next.js can manage
            both the frontend and backend functionality.
            API routes in Next.js provide the ideal way to interact with Wikidata by running SPARQL queries directly
            from the application.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2.3.2 Data Handling: Next.js API Routes </p></strong>
        <p>Since Next.js combines both the frontend and backend in the same project, API routes act as internal backend
          endpoints that can manage server-side logic such as fetching data from external sources (like Wikidata) and
          processing it.
          These routes allow you to structure the backend logic without needing an independent backend framework.
        <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Seamless Data Fetching</strong>: API routes in Next.js allow you to handle complex queries to
            external data sources, like Wikidata, without the need for separate backend services.
            When a user interacts with the frontend, the API route is called to fetch data, process it, and send a
            response back to the frontend.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexible Data Processing</strong>: Once data is fetched from Wikidata via SPARQL queries, it might
            need additional processing (e.g., calculating statistics, filtering data, or formatting it).
            API routes make it easy to process the data and format it according to the needs of the frontend.</li>
        </ul>



        <p><strong>2.3.3 Data Visualization: D3.js</strong></p>

        <p>D3.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating data visualizations. It allows you to manipulate the DOM
          (Document Object Model)
          and bind data to elements on the page, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive graphics, charts, and
          graphs.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Customizable Visualizations</strong>: D3.js offers advanced features for creating highly
            customized charts and visualizations. This means that you can create complex, interactive visualizations
            like network graphs, bar charts, pie charts, or any other custom graphic that suits your data.</li>
          <li><strong>Data Manipulation</strong>: D3.js excels at transforming data into visual elements, which is key
            when dealing with large datasets or requiring advanced manipulations (such as sorting, filtering, or
            grouping data).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2.3.4 Wikidata Interaction: SPARQL Endpoint</p></strong>
        <p>Wikidata is a large, open-source, structured knowledge base that stores data in RDF (Resource Description
          Framework) format. RDF data is ideal for representing complex relationships, which is why it’s commonly used
          for things
          like linked data, ontologies, and knowledge graphs. To query this data, you use SPARQL, a query language
          designed for querying RDF data. SPARQL allows you to retrieve specific information from Wikidata based on
          criterias.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Efficient Data Retrieval</strong> : SPARQL is highly efficient at retrieving structured data from
            large datasets like Wikidata.
            You can filter and retrieve specific data based on the conditions you define in your queries.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility in Querying</strong>: SPARQL allows for complex queries that can retrieve multiple
            types of information in a single query. For example, you can request data about an artist's works, the
            creation years of those works, and the artist’s country of origin all in one query. </li>
          <li><strong>Integration with Wikidata</strong>: Wikidata’s SPARQL endpoint is publicly accessible, meaning
            that you can directly query the database from your application without the need for a separate data
            collection process.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>3.2 Data Flows</h3>
          <p>The application interacts with Wikidata through SPARQL queries to gather information about artists, their
            influences, and the evolution of music genres.
            Below, we will describe how data is retrieved, processed, and transmitted between the application's
            components:</p>
          <p><strong> 3.2.1 User Inputs Data </strong></p>
          <p>The user initiates the search process by filling out a form on the frontend, where they can specify, based
            on the current webpage:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Time range</strong> (Start Year and End Year) to filter the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Country</strong> to filter artists by their place of origin (for painters).</li>
            <li><strong>Music Genre</strong> or <strong>Artist</strong> to explore musical influences.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This data is sent to the backend via a HTTP request that includes the specified parameters
            for the SPARQL query.</p>

          <p><strong> 3.2.2 API Request to the Backend</strong></p>
          <p>The backend (Next.js) receives the user's request and constructs the corresponding SPARQL query based on
            the user's input.</p>
          <p> <strong>3.2.2.1</strong> For Painters: If the user specifies a time period and a country, the backend will
            use the <strong>FINE_ARTS_QUERY_WITH_FILTERS</strong> query, which includes a filter for the start and end
            year, as well as the selected country. The query looks like this:</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="screenshot/queries6.png" alt="FINE_ARTS_QUERY_WITH_FILTERS" style="width: 500px; height: auto" />
          </figure>
          <p><strong>3.2.2.2</strong> For Music Artists and Their Influences: If the user wants to see the influences of
            a specific music artist, the backend will use the <strong>MUSIC_INFLUENCES_QUERY</strong>, which searches
            for musical artists and their influences based on the region (e.g., artists from the United States):</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="screenshot/queries2.png" alt="MUSIC_INFLUENCES_QUERY" style="width: 500px; height: auto" />
          </figure>
          <p><strong>3.2.2.3</strong> For music genre influences:The backend uses the query
            <strong>GENRE_INFLUENCES_QUERY</strong>, which retrieves a list of music genres
          </p>
          <figure>
            <img src="screenshot/queries3.png" alt="GENRE_INFLUENCES_QUERY" style="width: 500px; height: auto" />
          </figure>
          <p><strong>3.2.2.4</strong> In order to retrieve all the music genres that have the "influenced by" property:
            The
            backend uses the query <strong>MUSIC_GENRES_INFLUENCED_BY</strong>.
          <figure>
            <img src="screenshot/queries4.png" alt="MUSIC_GENRES_INFLUENCED_BY" style="width: 500px; height: auto" />
          </figure>
          <p><strong>3.2.2.5</strong> For exploring influences of a specific genre: The backend
            constructs a dynamic query using <strong>SELECT_GENRE_INFLUENCES_QUERY</strong>, where selectedGenre is
            replaced with the specific genre ID.</p>
          <figure>

          </figure>

          <p><strong>3.2.2.6 </strong>To provide the user with a list of regions (countries) to filter artists by: The
            backend uses the query <strong>REGIONS_QUERY</strong>.</p>

          <h3>3.4 Data Processing by the Backend</h3>
          <p>The backend receives the data from Wikidata and processes it:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Filtering and Structuring: The backend will structure the data into a format that can be easily used by
              the frontend. For example, it will create a JSON object containing artists and their works.</li>
            <li>Charts: The backend can create charts, such as the total number of works per artist, to send them to the
              frontend.</li>
          </ul>
